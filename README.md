# Day-58-of-100-days-of-python
🚀 Day 58 of #100DaysOfPython  Today I worked on building **advanced web forms using Flask-WTF and WTForms** — adding validation, improving form structure, and handling user input more efficiently. Also explored **Jinja2 template inheritance** and integrated **Bootstrap-Flask** for cleaner UI and reusable layouts.
